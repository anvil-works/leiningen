# Hello Github User!

The Leiningen project is in the process of [moving off
Github](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/).

This repository will continue to be updated as a mirror for a while as
we work to complete the move, but please switch your git remotes over
to https://codeberg.org/leiningen/leiningen

Codeberg works just like Github, and you can even use your Github
account to log in there, but it is operated like a user-owned
cooperative with a [democratic governance model](https://join.codeberg.org/)
instead of being an extractive arm of an unaccountable abusive megacorp.

As usual, you can join the `#leiningen` IRC channel on
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat) to discuss issues.

## For your consideration

I get it, Github is what *everyone* uses. But it's never been a good
idea to allow one company to have a monopoly, and it's an even worse
idea when that company has a history of abusing their monopoly.

If you haven't taken a look at Github alternatives, now's a great time
to evaluate a new home for your project! If you took a look at Gitlab
a few years ago and were put off by its clunkiness and bugs, you
should know that much better alternatives are available now.

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is perhaps the most polished
alternative, but [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/) is also quite nice
for minimalists, and if you're adventurous you could try running your
own [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/). Or maybe you [don't even need a
forge](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/git-no-forge/)?
