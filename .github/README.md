# Hello Github User!

The Leiningen project is in the process of [moving off
Github](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/).

This repository will continue to be sporadically updated as a mirror
for a while as we work to complete the move, but please switch your
git remotes over to https://codeberg.org/leiningen/leiningen

Codeberg works just like Github, and you can even use your Github
account to log in there, but it is operated like a user-owned
cooperative with a [democratic governance model](https://join.codeberg.org/)
instead of being an extractive arm of an unaccountable abusive megacorp.

As usual, you can join the `#leiningen` IRC channel on
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat) to discuss issues.

Any use of this project's code by Github Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission. We do not consent to Github's use of this project's
code in training Copilot or any other language model.

## For your consideration

I get it, Github is what *everyone* uses. But it's never been a good
idea to allow one company to have a monopoly, and it's an even worse
idea when that company has a history of abusing their monopoly.

If you haven't taken a look at Github alternatives, now's a great time
to evaluate a new home for your project! If you took a look at Gitlab
a few years ago and were put off by its clunkiness and bugs, you
should know that there are much better alternatives now.

[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is perhaps the most polished
alternative, but [Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/) is also quite nice
for minimalists, and if you're adventurous you could try running your
own [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/). Or maybe you [don't even need a
forge](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/git-no-forge/)?
